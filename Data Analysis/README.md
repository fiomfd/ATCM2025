Here are some notebooks: 
- **Julia & Pluto**: pluto_Data_Analysis.jl [html](https://fiomfd.github.io/ATCM2025/pluto_Data_Analysis.html)
- **MATLAB livescript**: 
- **Python & Jupyter Notebook**:  

These notebooks deal with:
- Data vectors
- Data matrices 
- Central limit theorem

Some of programs in these interactive notebooks download public data and extract meaningful information. Such interactive notebooks might be one of mordern effective styles of classes on data science including statistics.
