### Data Analysis

Here are some notebooks: 
- **Julia & Pluto**: pluto_Data_Analysis.jl [html](https://fiomfd.github.io/ATCM2025/pluto_Data_Analysis.html)
- **MATLAB livescript**: 
- **Python & Jupyter Notebook**:  

These notebooks deal with:
- Data vectors
- Data matrices 
- Central limit theorem

Some of these interactive notebook programs download public data and extract meaningful information. We believe that such interactive notebooks suggest a mordern style of classes on data science including statistics.
