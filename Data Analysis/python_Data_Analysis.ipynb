The Hong Kong Observatory dataset has no daily temperature records from 1 Jan 1940 to 31 Dec 1946, due to the disruption of WWII and the Japanese occupation. This 7-year gap means that analyses requiring continuous daily data over multiple years will be affected if these years are included. To ensure consistency, we restrict the analysis period to 1 Jan 1947 â€“ 31 Dec 2024."
